# IPFS Kubo RPC API for CGI
Wrapper shell scripts to do POST requests as GET requests. Works within CGI in Apache in GNU/Linux. API docs:
* https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc1zp5L56VMbfgfrQsGTRK9QmbzHWUtSMGaJ43jYPYRcZ/reference/kubo/rpc
* https://ipfs.io/ipns/docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc

There might be a config change to enable this, but I didn't look into it. Incomplete: see warning; change the local IP address to whichever one you use; not all API endpoints covered yet.
